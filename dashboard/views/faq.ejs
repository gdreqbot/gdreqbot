                    <p class="subtitle is-6">This may happen for the following reasons:</p>
                    <p>• gdreqbot is banned from your channel</p>
                    <p>• You are blacklisted from using gdreqbot</p>
                    <p>• Some other reason (please ask on Discord in this case)</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="title is-5">• The bot isn't responding in chat</p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">If any chat restrictions are applied (sub-only, follower-only, ...) you'll need to VIP or MOD gdreqbot</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="title is-5">• The bot responds twice with shared chat</p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">If you're streaming with the <strong>Streaming Together</strong> feature and have shared chat, make sure only one of you has added the bot to their channel</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="title is-5">• Is there a dashboard or GD mod to manage requests?</p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">As of now gdreqbot is used through the Twitch chat (see examples on the <a href="/">Home</a> page). I'll work on the dashboard soon. A GD mod is ""in the plans"" but won't come anytime soon</p>
